# Tomorrowland 2026 — crew planning PWA

Vite + React 18 SPA. Vercel serverless functions (`api/*.js`, auto-routed).
Upstash Redis for all shared state. Google OAuth (auth-code redirect at `/api/oauth`).

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — local dev (Vite on :5173; service worker does NOT register in dev).
  For sign-in to work locally you also need the API running: in a second terminal run
  `vercel dev --listen 3210` (Vite proxies `/api/*` to it), `vercel env pull` once for
  secrets, and register `http://localhost:5173/api/oauth` as an Authorized redirect URI
  on the Google OAuth client. Use Chrome/Firefox locally — Safari drops `Secure` cookies
  on http://localhost.
- `npm run build` — `vite build` + `node scripts/stamp-sw.mjs` (stamps the SW
  with the deploy's git SHA so the PWA detects updates — don't drop the stamp step)
- `npm test` — `vitest run` (tests are `api/**/*.test.js`, node env)

## Identity & data model (the thing that bites you)
- A user has ONE global display name: `session.person`, set at login in
  `api/_auth.js` (`resolvePersonName`). Renaming is global, not per-crew.
- Picks live in `group:<gid>:picks` as hash fields `<setId>|<person>` (split on
  the LAST `|`). `:status` and `:loc` are keyed by `<person>`.
- Membership: `group:<gid>:members[<email>]` = JSON {displayName,color,role,joinedAt};
  `user:<email>:groups` = set of gids; `joincode:<CODE>` → gid (30d TTL).
- Identify people by EMAIL, not display name — display names are user-set and
  often placeholders.

## Crews (groups)
- The original crew is `gid:'ldg'` (display name "The Budhole").
- Only `ldg` shows the Itinerary tab — gated on `activeGroupId === 'ldg'` in `App.jsx`.
- "Nunu" gate (server-enforced): non-Nunu members of `ldg` are blocked from
  leave/delete. Nunu = `NUNU_EMAILS` env (default grantxyzou@gmail.com).

## Tab headers (shared shell — the thing that bites you)
- Both tabs render ONE shared shell, `src/components/TabHeader.jsx`: a full-bleed
  gradient banner (height `HERO_H`, theme.js) with the identity strip (kicker ·
  crew · DEPARTURE IN · countdown) overlaid. Bodies are tab-specific:
  `itinerary/SkyHeader.jsx` (sky+clock) / `lineup/ConscienciaHeader.jsx` (wordmark).
  Keep them aligned by editing the shell, not per-tab. The full banner scrolls away
  with the page; it bleeds UP under the status bar (`margin`/`height`/identity-strip
  padding all add `env(safe-area-inset-top)`) so the sky fills the safe area — don't
  drop the safe-area terms or the harsh dark→sky line at the notch returns. Both tab
  bodies are `absolute inset:0` with bottom-anchored content, so the top-bleed doesn't
  move the clock/wordmark.
- Once the banner scrolls past, `TabHeader` reveals a COMPACT fixed header (crew ·
  statusChip · countdown) via an `IntersectionObserver` on a sentinel at `top:60` in
  the banner (`scrolled` state). Keep it lightweight (solid bg + hairline, no big blur
  shadow — it's a fixed layer and we watch scroll-repaint cost). Shared → both tabs.
- Countdown is ONE helper — `src/lib/countdown.js` `countdownLabel()` (uppercase
  `14 DAYS`). Don't reintroduce a second per-tab copy (that caused the old casing drift).
- Header type/size/height come from theme.js tokens (`HERO_H`, `hdr*`) — reference
  them, don't hand-set fontSize/height in the headers.
- Tab switch motion: only the banner BODY cross-fades (`fx-fade` on the body in
  TabHeader); the identity strip must NOT fade. Opacity cascades, so anything that
  must stay still cannot be under a fading ancestor.
- The tab SWITCHER lives in the BOTTOM bar, not the top: `lineup/TabPills.jsx` is a
  shared pill switcher (Itinerary/Lineup, styled like the account/day pills) rendered
  as the top row of BOTH bottom bars (`TripBar.jsx` + the Itinerary bar in
  `ItineraryTab.jsx`). App owns `activeTab`/`visibleTabs` and passes
  `{tabs, activeTab, onSelectTab}` down to both tabs. TabPills renders nothing when
  `tabs.length < 2` (non-`ldg` crews have only Lineup). Keep `role=tab` /
  `id="tab-<id>"` / `aria-controls="tabpanel"` so it still pairs with `<main>`.
- The identity strip has a `statusChip` slot (TabHeader): Lineup passes its pick-
  sync chip (`● LIVE`), Itinerary passes a static `LIVE` marker but ONLY when
  `viewingToday` (viewing today during the trip — see the Itinerary section); any
  other day it passes `null`. Only the passing tab shows it.

## Itinerary tab — one day at a time, picked by the DayScrubber
- The tab shows ONE day's card at a time — `days[viewIdx]` — NOT a scroll of all days.
  Which day is chosen by the `DayScrubber` (`itinerary/DayScrubber.jsx`), the row-2
  control in the bottom bar: a trip-wide timeline of discrete DAY stops (one per
  `trip.js` day). Tap / drag / arrow-key snaps to a whole day (`role=slider`), and only
  that day's `DayCard` renders (keyed by `viewIdx` so it replays `fx-enter` on switch).
- The scrubber picks the DAY, not the time — there is no time-of-day scrubbing anymore.
  `effectiveMinute = liveMinute` always, so the sky/tint just follow the device clock.
  `TimelineScrubber.jsx` (the old minute scrubber) is retired/unused; don't re-wire it.
- The Day pill (row 1) + its sheet are a second, labeled way to pick the day (with city
  names + Export PDF); it and the scrubber both drive `viewDayIdx`. Keep them in sync.
- Swipe left/right on the card pages prev/next day. Committing mounts a transient TWO-card
  track (`paging` state) that slides one card-width — the outgoing card slides off as the
  incoming slides in, continuous from the drag (no pop). The track's slots are keyed by day
  index so the `to` slot (and its loaded weather) PERSISTS across finalize — do not switch to
  a keyed single-card remount, it reintroduces a flash. The surface has `overflow:hidden` to
  clip the off-screen slot. Scrubber/sheet changes go through `goToDay(idx)` (instant swap +
  vertical `fx-enter`); `justPaged` suppresses that entrance on a paged-in card. Gesture
  mirrors OnboardingGate: `touch-action:pan-y` + axis-lock (`SWIPE_ENGAGE`=14px AND horizontal
  beats vertical 1.5×), `SWIPE_COMMIT`=90px, boundary no-op at day 0/last, `onClickCapture`
  guard so a swipe over a link/button doesn't also tap it, and a reduced-motion instant-swap
  fallback. The surface height is LOCKED to the outgoing card then animated to the measured
  incoming card's height (via `surfaceRef`/`trackRef`) so days of different lengths don't snap
  at settle. Tune feel via `SWIPE_ENGAGE`/`SWIPE_COMMIT` + `PAGE_DUR` (drives the slide, the
  height anim, and the finalize timer). The track `transform` + surface `overflow:hidden` are
  gated behind `active` (`paging || settling || dragX!==0`) — at REST the card is plain flow
  content (no transform/clip), else the always-on composited layer makes vertical scroll feel
  weird on long cards. Don't reintroduce an idle transform here.
- LIVE agenda: `AgendaPanel` + the banner `LIVE` chip show ONLY when `viewingToday`
  (`isTripLive && viewIdx === todayIdx`, `isTripLive = todayIdx >= 0` from
  `getTodayIndex()`, `?previewDay=N` to preview). Any other day: card only, no agenda.
- Icons use `@phosphor-icons/react` (NOT lucide) so they match the Lineup tab's family:
  `weight="fill"` for symbol glyphs (Bed/Clock/MapPin/Phone/Car/Train/AirplaneTilt),
  `weight="bold"` for carets/checks/X (matching Lineup's usage). Don't reintroduce
  lucide here. (App.jsx's settings sheet still uses lucide — a separate follow-up.)
- DayCard COLOR roles (palette `p` in `ItineraryTab.jsx`): surfaces are a deeper-navy
  lightness ladder so the card floats on the near-black `canvas` (don't collapse the
  `canvas`→`card` gap back to blue-on-blue). `accent` (red) is RESERVED for the day's
  status line + the TODAY marker — never times/links/icons. `gold` is the everyday
  structural tone (schedule times, weekday, all icons); festival days keep the distinct
  `tmrwGold`, flights keep `acRed`. Links: gold icon + light (`muted`) text.
- DayCard spacing goes through tokens at the top of `ItineraryTab.jsx` — `CARD_PAD`
  (panel padding), `SECTION_GAP` (header→body), `ROW_GAP` (list rows). Reference them in
  every panel instead of hardcoding, or the panels drift out of rhythm again. Tappable
  rows (lodging address→Maps via `mapsHref`, phone→dialer) share the `tapRow` layout (44px
  target); reuse `tapRow`+`mapsHref` for future taps (e.g. a travel-address Maps link).
  These consts sit AFTER `mono` (they spread it) to dodge the module-load TDZ.

## Bottom bars (keep the two matched — the thing that bites you)
- Both tabs have a fixed bottom bar: a scrollable pill row (Itinerary·Lineup via
  `lineup/TabPills.jsx`, Day, Account — same `chipStyle`/`rPill` geometry, mirrored
  in `TripBar.jsx` and the Itinerary bar in `ItineraryTab.jsx`) + a control row
  (Lineup: view switch; Itinerary: `DayScrubber`, always present). Keep both bars the
  SAME height: Lineup uses `minHeight: 157` to match the Itinerary scrubber row (content
  spacer 184). Change one bar's height → change the other AND its content spacer/padding.
- Bottom SHEETS cap at `sheetMaxW` (theme.js = 480) + `margin: 0 auto` so they don't
  span a wide desktop. Centre with margin, NOT translateX — `.fx-sheet`'s slide-up
  owns `transform`.
- Lineup FAB (`TripBar.jsx`): tap morphs +→× (one Plus rotated 45°, not a swap);
  Party mode + quick actions live in the fan-out; the closed FAB shows colored
  "new activity" dots diffed against a per-crew `tml2026_fab_seen_<gid>` baseline.

## Account sheet & Edit set times
- The account/settings sheet is App-level (`SettingsSheet` in `App.jsx`), opened
  from both bottom bars via `onOpenAccount`; it holds NO Lineup state.
- "Edit set times" is `ldg`-only and crew-wide (publishes shared set-time overrides),
  so it goes through a warning+confirm. Since the sheet can't reach LineupTab, it
  uses a one-shot App→Lineup signal (`pendingEditTimes` → LineupTab consumes it →
  opens the Time view in edit mode). Don't try to render Lineup views in the sheet.

## PWA / freshness
- `public/sw.js` is network-first for navigation/`/api/picks`, SWR for hashed
  assets; `skipWaiting` + `clients.claim`. VERSION is `__BUILD_ID__`, stamped per
  deploy. `src/main.jsx` reloads once on `controllerchange` so a warm PWA picks
  up new deploys without a force-quit.
- First-run onboarding: `OnboardingGate` (`main.jsx`, between AuthGate & GroupGate)
  shows swipeable slides when signed-in + `groups.length === 0` (never joined a crew)
  + not dismissed. Show-once UI uses `tml2026_*` localStorage flags (`_onboarded`,
  `_tip`, `_fab_side`, `_fab_seen_<gid>`), each guarded with try/catch.

## Deploy / ops gotchas
- Public alias: `tomorrowland-iten-2026.vercel.app`. Deployment-Protection (SSO)
  guards the raw deployment / `-projects` URLs — always test on the alias, and
  OAuth `redirect_uri` must match the alias (not a deployment URL).
- `vercel logs` needs `--since` for historical (positional deploy arg only streams).
- Required env: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET, SESSION_SECRET, UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL/TOKEN,
  NUNU_EMAILS. Never commit secrets.
- Local-dev sign-in works via `vercel dev` + the localhost redirect URI (see Commands).
  `api/oauth.js` `redirectUri()` uses http for localhost, https everywhere else.
